Render a badge to quickly communicate project values.


# Usage

  * Meditate on your projects' values. You can pick up to 4.

  * Add an image tag:

    ```html
      <img src="https://portioncontrol.herokuapp.com/pie.png?size=250x250&performance=65&readabilty=15&scalability=20" alt="pie chart showing performance: 65, readability: 15, scalability: 20" width=125 height=125 />
    ```

Don't forget the `alt` tag for a11y. Doubling the size makes it look nice on retina screens.

Enjoy!
